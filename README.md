The paper "A Pilot Study and Stress-Predict Dataset" covers an experiment that was conducted to examine the efficiency of wearable sensors to track stress levels. The study used wrist-worn sensors to collect physiological data from participants, which was then analysed via algorithms that used machine learning to predict stress levels.The report offers the findings of the pilot study, that demonstrated that the detectors were efficient for evaluating physiological stress indicators such as changes in heart rate and skin conductance. The models based on machine learning created using this data were highly accurate in predicting stress levels. The report additionally includes the Stress-Predict information set, which contains physiological data gathered by wearable sensors throughout the pilot study. 

The report additionally provides the Stress-Predict dataset, containing physiological data gathered from wearable sensors through the pilot study. The dataset is designed to aid future research into stress monitoring and prediction.

Overall, the report emphasises the possibility of wearable sensors and machine learning methods for monitoring and predicting levels of stress, and it serves as a valuable resource for investigators working in this field.
